This repository demonstrates a common Java programming error: accessing an array element outside of its valid index range. The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, which results in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `bugSolution.java` file provides a corrected version of the code. This example highlights the importance of carefully checking array indices to avoid runtime exceptions.
